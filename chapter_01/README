I've updated this code example to work with bundler so specific gem versions can be more easily installed. I've also tested with Ruby 1.9.2p0.

The best way to get on 1.9.2p0 if you aren't already is to use RVM (http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/). Then install bundler with the following:
gem install bundler --version=1.0.7

Then install the gems:
bundle install

Now you'll have to create the database. Do this from the command line:
rake db:migrate

Then you can run the service specs by doing this:
rspec spec/service_spec.rb

Note that you should be using the rspec command. It used to be spec, but with new versions this will throw an error.
